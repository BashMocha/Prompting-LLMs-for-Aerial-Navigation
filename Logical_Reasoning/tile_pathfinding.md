Imagine we are working with a robot that can move in four directions with a given tile number in north(tile_num), south(tile_num), west(tile_num), and, east(tile_num) on a 9x9 square tiling ground. The robot in the x=0, y=0 tile (upper-left corner) and should reach the x=8, y=8 (bottom-right corner) without entering a tile with any obstacles and exceeding the tile ground. The detection of an obstacle in a direction can be checked with any_obstacle(direction). 
If there is an obstacle in the moving direction, the robot must search for an alternative direction. Assume that there is always a possible path for the target position. 
Can you give me the  Python code that performs this task?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, here's a Python code that accomplishes the task using a simple algorithm:
```python
def any_obstacle(direction):
    # Function to simulate obstacle detection
    # Return True if there is an obstacle, False otherwise
    pass

def move_robot(direction, tile_num):
    # Function to move the robot in a given direction by a specified number of tiles
    # In a real implementation, this function would actually move the robot
    pass

def reach_destination():
    # Function to make the robot reach the destination (8, 8)
    x, y = 0, 0  # Initial position
    while x != 8 or y != 8:  # Continue moving until reaching the destination
        if x < 8 and not any_obstacle('east'):  # Move east if possible
            move_robot('east', 1)
            x += 1
        elif y < 8 and not any_obstacle('south'):  # Move south if possible
            move_robot('south', 1)
            y += 1
        elif x > 0 and not any_obstacle('west'):  # Move west if possible
            move_robot('west', 1)
            x -= 1
        elif y > 0 and not any_obstacle('north'):  # Move north if possible
            move_robot('north', 1)
            y -= 1
        else:
            print("Stuck! There seems to be an issue with the obstacle detection or pathfinding.")
            break

# Call the function to make the robot reach the destination
reach_destination()
```

You need to implement the `any_obstacle(direction)` and `move_robot(direction, tile_num)` functions according to your specific robot platform or simulation environment. This code assumes that the obstacle detection function `any_obstacle(direction)` returns 
`True` if there is an obstacle in the specified direction and `False` otherwise. Similarly, the `move_robot(direction, tile_num)` function moves the robot in the given direction by the specified number of tiles.
