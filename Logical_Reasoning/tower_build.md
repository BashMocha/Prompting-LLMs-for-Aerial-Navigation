Imagine we are working with a manipulator robot. This is a robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom that has a suction pump attached to its end effector. I want you to assist me in sending commands to this robot given a scene and a task.

At any point, you have access to the following functions:

grab(): Turn on the suction pump to grab an object
release(): Turns off the suction pump to release an object
get_position(object): Given a string of an object name, returns the coordinates and orientation of the vacuum pump to touch the top of the object [X, Y, Z, Yaw, Pitch, Roll]move_to(position): It moves the suction pump to a given position [X, Y, Z, Yaw, Pitch, Roll].

You are allowed to create new functions using these, but you are not allowed to use any other hypothetical functions.

Here is the scene that contains the problem:
On a white pad, a blue block, yellow block, green block, and red block should stand from bottom to top respectively on top of each other.
 
I want you to build the given tower using cube blocks with a height of 40 mm without destroying the structure of the tower. Assume that a sufficient number of blocks are given to you.

Can you give me the Python code that performs this task?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! We can approach this task step by step. First, we need to define the positions for each block in the tower, then we'll instruct the robot to pick up each block and stack them accordingly. Here's how we can do it:

```python
# Define positions for each block in the tower
block_positions = {
    "blue": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    "yellow": [0, 0, 40, 0, 0, 0],
    "green": [0, 0, 80, 0, 0, 0],
    "red": [0, 0, 120, 0, 0, 0]
}

# Function to build the tower
def build_tower():
    for color, position in block_positions.items():
        # Move to the position above the target block
        position_above = [position[0], position[1], position[2] + 40, position[3], position[4], position[5]]
        move_to(position_above)
        
        # Get the position to grab the block
        grab_position = get_position(color)
        
        # Move to the grab position
        move_to(grab_position)
        
        # Grab the block
        grab()
        
        # Move to the position above the target block
        move_to(position_above)
        
        # Move to the position to place the block
        move_to(position)
        
        # Release the block
        release()

# Call the function to build the tower
build_tower()
```

This code assumes that the robot arm has a function `move_to()` that moves the suction pump to a given position, 
`grab()` and `release()` functions to control the suction pump, and `get_position(object)` to get the coordinates and orientation of the vacuum pump to touch the top of the object.
