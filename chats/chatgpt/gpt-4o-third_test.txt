system: 
You are an assistant helping me with the AirSim simulator for drones.
When I ask you to do something, you are supposed to give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task using AirSim and then an explanation of what that code does.
You are only allowed to use the functions I have defined for you.
You are not to use any other hypothetical functions that you think might exist.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.
You are supposed to output the code in a single block and double-check that the output does not contain syntax errors to avoid outputting erroneous code.

move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
    aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
    ```

    This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

<------>

user: 
Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

assistant: 
```python
import airsim

# Take off the drone
aw.takeoff()

# Get the current position of the drone
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()

# Calculate the new position 10 units up
new_position = [current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2] + 10]

# Fly the drone to the new position
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

Explanation:
1. `aw.takeoff()`: This command takes off the drone.
2. `current_position = aw.get_drone_position()`: This retrieves the current position of the drone as a list of three floats representing the X, Y, and Z coordinates.
3. `new_position = [current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2] + 10]`: This calculates the new position by keeping the X and Y coordinates the same and increasing the Z coordinate by 10 units.
4. `aw.fly_to(new_position)`: This command flies the drone to the new position calculated in the previous step.

user: 
I want you to perform multiple tasks in an order, one by one. Take off, fly up 30 meters, and fly 20 meters forward. Rotate the drone 180 degrees and then, fly 20 meters forward to return your original position.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import airsim

# Take off the drone
aw.takeoff()

# Get the current position of the drone
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()

# Calculate the new position 30 meters up
position_up = [current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2] + 30]

# Fly the drone 30 meters up
aw.fly_to(position_up)

# Calculate the new position 20 meters forward
position_forward = [position_up[0] + 20, position_up[1], position_up[2]]

# Fly the drone 20 meters forward
aw.fly_to(position_forward)

# Rotate the drone 180 degrees
current_yaw = aw.get_yaw()
new_yaw = (current_yaw + 180) % 360
aw.set_yaw(new_yaw)

# Fly the drone 20 meters forward to return to the original position
aw.fly_to(position_up)
```

6. `aw.fly_to(position_forward)`: Flies the drone 20 meters forward.
7. `current_yaw = aw.get_yaw()`: Retrieves the current yaw of the drone.
8. `new_yaw = (current_yaw + 180) % 360`: Calculates the new yaw by adding 180 degrees to the current yaw.
9. `aw.set_yaw(new_yaw)`: Sets the yaw of the drone to the new yaw (180 degrees rotated).
10. `aw.fly_to(position_up)`: Flies the drone 20 meters forward to return to the original position.

Excellent, I want to inspect the car from three different points on the X axis. You can inspect the car from the front, back, and right side from 20 meters away on the X-axis. After examining the car from a point, wait three seconds and move to the next point. Finally set yaw to zero.

front_position = [car_position[0] + 20, car_position[1], car_position[2]]
back_position = [car_position[0] - 20, car_position[1], car_position[2]]
right_position = [car_position[0], car_position[1] + 20, car_position[2]]

# Fly to the front position and wait for 3 seconds
aw.fly_to(front_position)
time.sleep(3)

# Fly to the back position and wait for 3 seconds
aw.fly_to(back_position)

Great! I want you to fly to the turbine 1 until 15m distance on the X axis in the negative direction, and reach an altitude of 50 meters. Remember that you are on the front side of the turbine right now. Right after that, lower your altitude to 30 meters and fly to the next turbine until 15-meter distance in the negative direction, and reach an altitude of 50 meters again.

Let's inspect this turbine, perform the following tasks in an order, one by one. I want you to move backwards 15 meters on the X axis, wait for 3 seconds and fly back to your first position. After that you'll repeat the process for the backside of the turbine in the following instructions. You should fly 10 meters rightwards, 30 meters forward, 10 meters leftwards and then set yaw to zero to inspect the turbine from the backside. Finally move 10 meters forward, and wait for 3 seconds.

Amazing! As a final task, lower your altitude to 25 meters to not to hit the wheel of the turbine and then land the drone 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis.
