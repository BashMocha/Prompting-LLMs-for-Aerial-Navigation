system: 
You are an assistant helping me with the AirSim simulator for drones.
When I ask you to do something, you are supposed to give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task using AirSim and then an explanation of what that code does.
You are only allowed to use the functions I have defined for you.
You are not to use any other hypothetical functions that you think might exist.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.
You are supposed to output the code in a single block and double-check that the output does not contain syntax errors to avoid outputting erroneous code.

user: 
move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
    aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
    ```

    This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

<------>

user: 
Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

<------>

assistant: 
Understood, I will use the provided functions and guidelines to assist you with controlling the drone in the AirSim simulator. If you have any specific tasks or movements you want the drone to perform, please let me know!

<------>

user: 
Take off please.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
aw.takeoff()
```

This code calls the `takeoff()` function to initiate the drone's takeoff procedure. This function is responsible for getting the drone airborne from its current position on the ground.

<------>

user: 
Fly 20 meters up.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
new_position = [current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2] + 20]
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code snippet first retrieves the current position of the drone using `aw.get_drone_position()`, which returns the XYZ coordinates. It then creates a new position list, `new_position`, where the X and Y coordinates remain the same, but the Z coordinate (altitude) is increased by 20 meters. Finally, the drone is instructed to fly to this new position using the `aw.fly_to()` function.

<------>

user: 
Fly 30 meters forward.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
new_position = [current_position[0] + 30, current_position[1], current_position[2]]
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code retrieves the current position of the drone and then calculates a new position by adding 30 meters to the X coordinate, which corresponds to moving forward along the positive X-axis. The Y and Z coordinates remain unchanged. The drone is then commanded to fly to this new position using the `aw.fly_to()` function.

<------>

user: 
Fly 10 meters to leftwards.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
new_position = [current_position[0], current_position[1] - 10, current_position[2]]
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code snippet retrieves the current position of the drone and then adjusts the Y coordinate by subtracting 10 meters to move the drone leftwards (towards the negative Y-axis). The X and Z coordinates remain unchanged. The drone is then instructed to fly to this updated position using the `aw.fly_to()` function.

<------>

user: 
Fly to the solar panel. Remember to keep a 30-meter distance on the Z axis.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
solar_panel_position = aw.get_position("solarpanels")
new_position = [solar_panel_position[0], solar_panel_position[1], solar_panel_position[2] + 30]
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code first retrieves the position of the "solarpanels" using the `aw.get_position()` function. It then creates a new position list, `new_position`, where the X and Y coordinates are the same as those of the solar panels, but the Z coordinate is increased by 30 meters to maintain a vertical distance of 30 meters from the solar panels. Finally, the drone is instructed to fly to this new position using the `aw.fly_to()` function.

<------>

user: 
Great! Fly to a turbine, keep a 15m distance on the X axis.

<------>

assistant: 
Question - there are two turbines, turbine1 and turbine2. Which one do you want me to fly to?

<------>

user: 
Turbine 1 please.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
turbine1_position = aw.get_position("turbine1")
new_position = [turbine1_position[0] + 15, turbine1_position[1], turbine1_position[2]]
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code retrieves the position of "turbine1" using the `aw.get_position()` function. It then creates a new position list, `new_position`, where the X coordinate is increased by 15 meters to maintain a horizontal distance of 15 meters from turbine1, while the Y and Z coordinates remain the same as those of the turbine. The drone is then instructed to fly to this updated position using the `aw.fly_to()` function.

<------>

user: 
Excellent. Now, fly to the turbine 2 and keep a 20m distance on the X-axis.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
turbine2_position = aw.get_position("turbine2")
new_position = [turbine2_position[0] + 20, turbine2_position[1], turbine2_position[2]]
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code retrieves the position of "turbine2" using the `aw.get_position()` function. It then adjusts the X coordinate by adding 20 meters to create a new position list, `new_position`, where the drone will maintain a 20-meter distance on the X-axis from turbine2. The Y and Z coordinates remain the same as those of the turbine. The drone is then commanded to fly to this new position using the `aw.fly_to()` function.

<------>

user: 
As a final task, I want you to hover 5 meters above the car.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
car_position = aw.get_position("car")
new_position = [car_position[0], car_position[1], car_position[2] + 5]
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code retrieves the position of the "car" using the `aw.get_position()` function. It then creates a new position list, `new_position`, where the X and Y coordinates are the same as those of the car, but the Z coordinate is increased by 5 meters. This adjustment allows the drone to hover 5 meters directly above the car. The drone is then instructed to fly to this new position using the `aw.fly_to()` function.

<------>
