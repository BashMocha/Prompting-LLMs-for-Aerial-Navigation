system: 
You are an assistant helping me with the AirSim simulator for drones.
When I ask you to do something, you are supposed to give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task using AirSim and then an explanation of what that code does.
You are only allowed to use the functions I have defined for you.
You are not to use any other hypothetical functions that you think might exist.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.
You are supposed to output the code in a single block and double-check that the output does not contain syntax errors to avoid outputting erroneous code.

user: 
move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
    aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
    ```

    This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

user: 
Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

assistant: 
```python
import airsim

# Take off the drone
aw.takeoff()

# Get the current position of the drone
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()

# Calculate the new position 10 units up
new_position = [current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2] + 10]

# Fly the drone to the new position
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code performs the following steps:
1. Takes off the drone using `aw.takeoff()`.
2. Retrieves the current position of the drone using `aw.get_drone_position()`.
3. Calculates a new position that is 10 units higher in the Z-axis by adding 10 to the current Z coordinate.
4. Commands the drone to fly to the new position using `aw.fly_to(new_position)`.

<------>

user: 
Take off please.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import airsim

# Take off the drone
aw.takeoff()
```

This code uses the `aw.takeoff()` function to take off the drone.

<------>

user: 
Fly 30 meters up.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import airsim

# Get the current position of the drone
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()

# Calculate the new position 30 meters up
new_position = [current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2] + 30]

# Fly the drone to the new position
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves the current position of the drone using `aw.get_drone_position()`.
2. Calculates a new position that is 30 meters higher in the Z-axis by adding 30 to the current Z coordinate.
3. Commands the drone to fly to the new position using `aw.fly_to(new_position)`.

user: 
Now I want you to draw a circle with 45 meters radius, you can use the math.cos() and math.sin() functions to calculate the points of the circle. Remember that the drone has a width of 2 meters.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import airsim
import math

# Get the current position of the drone
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()

# Define the radius of the circle
radius = 45

# Define the number of points to create the circle
num_points = 36  # This will create a point every 10 degrees

# Calculate the points of the circle
circle_points = []
for i in range(num_points):
    angle = 2 * math.pi * i / num_points
    x = current_position[0] + radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = current_position[1] + radius * math.sin(angle)
    z = current_position[2]
    circle_points.append([x, y, z])

# Fly the drone along the circle path
aw.fly_path(circle_points)
```

This code performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves the current position of the drone using `aw.get_drone_position()`.
2. Defines the radius of the circle as 45 meters.
3. Defines the number of points to create the circle. In this case, 36 points are used to create a point every 10 degrees.
4. Calculates the points of the circle using the `math.cos()` and `math.sin()` functions. Each point is calculated based on the angle and the radius, and the points are added to the `circle_points` list.
5. Commands the drone to fly along the circle path using `aw.fly_path(circle_points)`.
