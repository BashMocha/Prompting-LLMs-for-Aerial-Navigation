system: 
You are an assistant helping me with the AirSim simulator for drones.
When I ask you to do something, you are supposed to give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task using AirSim and then an explanation of what that code does.
You are only allowed to use the functions I have defined for you.
You are not to use any other hypothetical functions that you think might exist.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.
You are supposed to output the code in a single block and double-check that the output does not contain syntax errors to avoid outputting erroneous code.

user: 
move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
    aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
    ```

    This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

user: 
Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

assistant: 
```python
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2]+10])
```

This code first gets the current position of the drone using the `aw.get_drone_position()` function and stores it in the `current_position` variable. The `aw.fly_to()` function is then used to command the drone to fly to a new position. The new position is the same as the current position, except that the Z coordinate (which represents height) is increased by 10 units, causing the drone to move up.

<------>

user: 
Take off please.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
aw.takeoff()
```

This code calls the `aw.takeoff()` function, which commands the drone to take off from its current position.

<------>

user: 
Fly 30 meters up.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2]+30])
```

This code first gets the current position of the drone using the `aw.get_drone_position()` function and stores it in the `current_position` variable. The `aw.fly_to()` function is then used to command the drone to fly to a new position. The new position is the same as the current position, except that the Z coordinate (which represents height) is increased by 30 units, causing the drone to move up by 30 meters.

user: 
Now I want you to draw a circle with 45 meters radius, you can use the math.cos() and math.sin() functions to calculate the points of the circle. Remember that the drone has a width of 2 meters.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import math

# Define the center of the circle as the current position of the drone
center = aw.get_drone_position()

# Define the radius of the circle
radius = 45

# Define the number of points in the circle
num_points = 100

# Calculate the points of the circle
points = []
for i in range(num_points):
    angle = 2 * math.pi * i / num_points
    x = center[0] + radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = center[1] + radius * math.sin(angle)
    z = center[2]
    points.append([x, y, z])

# Fly the drone along the path defined by the points of the circle
aw.fly_path(points)
```

This code first defines the center of the circle as the current position of the drone and the radius of the circle as 45 meters. It then calculates the points of the circle using the `math.cos()` and `math.sin()` functions. The points are calculated in a loop that runs `num_points` times, with each iteration corresponding to a different angle around the circle. The X and Y coordinates of each point are calculated by adding the radius times the cosine or sine of the angle to the X or Y coordinate of the center, respectively. The Z coordinate of each point is the same as the Z coordinate of the center. The points are then added to a list, which is passed to the `aw.fly_path()` function to command the drone to fly along the path defined by the points of the circle.
