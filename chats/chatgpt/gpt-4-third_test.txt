system: 
You are an assistant helping me with the AirSim simulator for drones.
When I ask you to do something, you are supposed to give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task using AirSim and then an explanation of what that code does.
You are only allowed to use the functions I have defined for you.
You are not to use any other hypothetical functions that you think might exist.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.
You are supposed to output the code in a single block and double-check that the output does not contain syntax errors to avoid outputting erroneous code.

move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
    aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
    ```

    This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

user: 
Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2]+10])
```

This code first gets the current position of the drone using the `aw.get_drone_position()` function and stores it in the `current_position` variable. The `aw.fly_to()` function is then used to command the drone to fly to a new position. The new position is the same as the current position, except that the Z coordinate (which represents height) is increased by 10 units, causing the drone to move up.

user: 
I want you to perform multiple tasks in an order, one by one. Take off, fly up 30 meters, and fly 20 meters forward. Rotate the drone 180 degrees and then, fly 20 meters forward to return your original position.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
# Take off
aw.takeoff()

# Fly up 30 meters
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2]+30])

# Fly 20 meters forward
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0]+20, current_position[1], current_position[2]])

# Rotate the drone 180 degrees
current_yaw = aw.get_yaw()
aw.set_yaw(current_yaw + 180)

# Fly 20 meters forward to return to the original position
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0]+20, current_position[1], current_position[2]])
```

This code first takes off the drone using the `aw.takeoff()` function. Then, it gets the current position of the drone using the `aw.get_drone_position()` function and flies up 30 meters by increasing the Z coordinate of the current position by 30. 

Next, it gets the updated position of the drone and flies 20 meters forward by increasing the X coordinate of the current position by 20 (since forward means positive X axis).

Then, it gets the current yaw of the drone using the `aw.get_yaw()` function and rotates the drone 180 degrees by adding 180 to the current yaw.

Finally, it gets the updated position of the drone again and flies 20 meters forward to return to the original position by increasing the X coordinate of the current position by 20.

user: 
Excellent, I want to inspect the car from three different points on the X axis. You can inspect the car from the front, back, and right side from 20 meters away on the X-axis. After examining the car from a point, wait three seconds and move to the next point. Finally set yaw to zero.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import time

# Get the position of the car
car_position = aw.get_position('car')

# Inspect the car from the front
aw.fly_to([car_position[0]+20, car_position[1], car_position[2]])
time.sleep(3)

# Inspect the car from the back
aw.fly_to([car_position[0]-20, car_position[1], car_position[2]])
time.sleep(3)

# Inspect the car from the right side
aw.fly_to([car_position[0], car_position[1]+20, car_position[2]])
time.sleep(3)

# Set yaw to zero
aw.set_yaw(0)
```

This code first gets the position of the car using the `aw.get_position('car')` function. 

Then, it flies the drone to a point 20 meters in front of the car on the X-axis by adding 20 to the X coordinate of the car's position. It waits for 3 seconds using the `time.sleep(3)` function.

Next, it flies the drone to a point 20 meters behind the car on the X-axis by subtracting 20 from the X coordinate of the car's position. It waits for 3 seconds again.

Then, it flies the drone to a point 20 meters to the right of the car on the Y-axis by adding 20 to the Y coordinate of the car's position. It waits for 3 seconds again.

Finally, it sets the yaw of the drone to zero using the `aw.set_yaw(0)` function.

user: 
Great! I want you to fly to the turbine 1 until 15m distance on the X axis in the negative direction, and reach an altitude of 50 meters. Remember that you are on the front side of the turbine right now. Right after that, lower your altitude to 30 meters and fly to the next turbine until 15-meter distance in the negative direction, and reach an altitude of 50 meters again.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
# Get the position of turbine1
turbine1_position = aw.get_position('turbine1')

# Fly to a point 15 meters in the negative direction of the X-axis from turbine1 and reach an altitude of 50 meters
aw.fly_to([turbine1_position[0]-15, turbine1_position[1], 50])

# Lower the altitude to 30 meters
aw.fly_to([turbine1_position[0]-15, turbine1_position[1], 30])

# Get the position of turbine2
turbine2_position = aw.get_position('turbine2')

# Fly to a point 15 meters in the negative direction of the X-axis from turbine2 and reach an altitude of 50 meters
aw.fly_to([turbine2_position[0]-15, turbine2_position[1], 50])
```

This code first gets the position of turbine1 using the `aw.get_position('turbine1')` function. 

Then, it flies the drone to a point 15 meters in the negative direction of the X-axis from turbine1 and reaches an altitude of 50 meters by setting the X coordinate to `turbine1_position[0]-15` and the Z coordinate to `50`.

Next, it lowers the altitude to 30 meters by flying the drone to the same X and Y coordinates but with a Z coordinate of `30`.

Then, it gets the position of turbine2 using the `aw.get_position('turbine2')` function.

Finally, it flies the drone to a point 15 meters in the negative direction of the X-axis from turbine2 and reaches an altitude of 50 meters by setting the X coordinate to `turbine2_position[0]-15` and the Z coordinate to `50`.

user: 
Let's inspect this turbine, perform the following tasks in an order, one by one. I want you to move backwards 15 meters on the X axis, wait for 3 seconds and fly back to your first position. After that you'll repeat the process for the backside of the turbine in the following instructions. You should fly 10 meters rightwards, 30 meters forward, 10 meters leftwards and then set yaw to zero to inspect the turbine from the backside. Finally move 10 meters forward, and wait for 3 seconds.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import time

# Get the current position of the drone
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()

# Move backwards 15 meters on the X axis
aw.fly_to([current_position[0]-15, current_position[1], current_position[2]])
time.sleep(3)

# Fly back to the first position
aw.fly_to(current_position)

# Fly 10 meters rightwards
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0], current_position[1]+10, current_position[2]])

# Fly 30 meters forward
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0]+30, current_position[1], current_position[2]])

# Fly 10 meters leftwards
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0], current_position[1]-10, current_position[2]])

# Set yaw to zero
aw.set_yaw(0)

# Move 10 meters forward
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0]+10, current_position[1], current_position[2]])

# Wait for 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)
```

This code first gets the current position of the drone using the `aw.get_drone_position()` function. 

Then, it moves the drone backwards 15 meters on the X axis by subtracting 15 from the X coordinate of the current position. It waits for 3 seconds using the `time.sleep(3)` function.

Next, it flies the drone back to the first position using the `aw.fly_to(current_position)` function.

Then, it flies the drone 10 meters rightwards, 30 meters forward, and 10 meters leftwards by updating the X and Y coordinates of the current position accordingly.

After that, it sets the yaw of the drone to zero using the `aw.set_yaw(0)` function.

Finally, it moves the drone 10 meters forward by adding 10 to the X coordinate of the current position and waits for 3 seconds.

user: 
Amazing! As a final task, lower your altitude to 25 meters to not to hit the wheel of the turbine and then land the drone 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
# Lower the altitude to 25 meters
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
aw.fly_to([current_position[0], current_position[1], 25])

# Get the position of the car
car_position = aw.get_position('car')

# Land the drone 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis
aw.fly_to([car_position[0]+10, car_position[1], 25])
aw.land()
```

This code first lowers the altitude of the drone to 25 meters by flying the drone to the same X and Y coordinates but with a Z coordinate of `25`.

Then, it gets the position of the car using the `aw.get_position('car')` function.

Finally, it lands the drone 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis by flying the drone to a point with an X coordinate of `car_position[0]+10` and a Z coordinate of `25`, and then landing the drone using the `aw.land()` function.
