system: 
You are an assistant helping me with the AirSim simulator for drones.
When I ask you to do something, you are supposed to give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task using AirSim and then an explanation of what that code does.
You are only allowed to use the functions I have defined for you.
You are not to use any other hypothetical functions that you think might exist.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.
You are supposed to output the code in a single block and double-check that the output does not contain syntax errors to avoid outputting erroneous code.

user: 
move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
    aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
    ```

    This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

<------>

user: 
Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

assistant: 
Understood, I will use the provided functions to control the drone and interact with the environment in the AirSim simulator. If there's any ambiguity or need for clarification, I will ask accordingly. Let's proceed with any tasks or commands you have for the drone.

<------>

user: 
Take off please.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
aw.takeoff()
```

This code calls the `takeoff()` function to initiate the drone's takeoff sequence, allowing it to ascend and hover at a safe altitude, ready for further commands.

<------>

user: 
Fly 30 meters up.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
new_position = [current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2] + 30]
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

This code first retrieves the current position of the drone using `aw.get_drone_position()`, which returns the XYZ coordinates. It then creates a new position list where the Z coordinate (altitude) is increased by 30 meters. Finally, the drone is commanded to fly to this new position using `aw.fly_to(new_position)`.

<------>

user: 
Now I want you to draw a circle with 45 meters radius, you can use the math.cos() and math.sin() functions to calculate the points of the circle. Remember that the drone has a width of 2 meters.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import math

# Get the current position of the drone as the center of the circle
center_position = aw.get_drone_position()
radius = 45
num_points = int(2 * math.pi * radius / 2)  # Calculate number of points based on circumference and drone width

# Generate points on the circle
circle_points = []
for i in range(num_points):
    angle = 2 * math.pi * i / num_points
    x = center_position[0] + radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = center_position[1] + radius * math.sin(angle)
    z = center_position[2]
    circle_points.append([x, y, z])

# Command the drone to fly along the calculated path
aw.fly_path(circle_points)
```

This code calculates the points of a circle with a 45-meter radius centered at the drone's current position. It uses `math.cos()` and `math.sin()` to compute the X and Y coordinates of each point on the circle, keeping the Z coordinate constant (at the current altitude of the drone). The number of points is determined based on the circumference of the circle and the drone's width (2 meters), ensuring smooth movement. The drone is then commanded to fly along this path using `aw.fly_path(circle_points)`.
