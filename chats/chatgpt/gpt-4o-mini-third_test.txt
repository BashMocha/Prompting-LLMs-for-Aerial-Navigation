system: 
You are an assistant helping me with the AirSim simulator for drones.
When I ask you to do something, you are supposed to give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task using AirSim and then an explanation of what that code does.
You are only allowed to use the functions I have defined for you.
You are not to use any other hypothetical functions that you think might exist.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.
You are supposed to output the code in a single block and double-check that the output does not contain syntax errors to avoid outputting erroneous code.

move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
    aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
    ```

    This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

<------>

user: 
Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

<------>

assistant: 
Understood! If you would like to move the drone 10 units up, here is the code to achieve that:

```python
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2] + 10])
```

This code retrieves the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()`, which returns a list of the current X, Y, and Z coordinates. It then constructs a new position by keeping the X and Y coordinates the same while increasing the Z coordinate by 10 units. Finally, it commands the drone to fly to this new position using the `fly_to()` function.

<------>

user: 
I want you to perform multiple tasks in an order, one by one. Take off, fly up 30 meters, and fly 20 meters forward. Rotate the drone 180 degrees and then, fly 20 meters forward to return your original position.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
# Take off the drone
aw.takeoff()

# Fly up 30 meters
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2] + 30])

# Fly 20 meters forward (positive X direction)
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] + 20, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])

# Rotate the drone 180 degrees
aw.set_yaw(aw.get_yaw() + 180)

# Fly 20 meters backward to return to the original position
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] - 20, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])
```

This code performs the following tasks in order:

1. **Take off the drone**: The `aw.takeoff()` function is called to lift the drone off the ground.
2. **Fly up 30 meters**: The drone's current position is retrieved, and the Z coordinate is increased by 30 meters using `fly_to()`.
3. **Fly 20 meters forward**: The drone moves forward in the positive X direction by adding 20 to the current X coordinate while keeping Y and Z the same.
4. **Rotate the drone 180 degrees**: The current yaw is retrieved using `get_yaw()`, and 180 degrees is added to it using `set_yaw()`, effectively turning the drone around.
5. **Fly 20 meters backward**: The drone returns to its original position by subtracting 20 from the current X coordinate while keeping Y and Z the same. 

This sequence of commands will achieve the desired flight path.

user: 
Excellent, I want to inspect the car from three different points on the X axis. You can inspect the car from the front, back, and right side from 20 meters away on the X-axis. After examining the car from a point, wait three seconds and move to the next point. Finally set yaw to zero.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import time

# Define the car's position
car_position = aw.get_position("car")

# Inspect from the front (20 meters in positive X direction)
aw.fly_to([car_position[0] + 20, car_position[1], car_position[2]])
time.sleep(3)  # Wait for 3 seconds

# Inspect from the back (20 meters in negative X direction)
aw.fly_to([car_position[0] - 20, car_position[1], car_position[2]])
time.sleep(3)  # Wait for 3 seconds

# Inspect from the right side (20 meters in positive Y direction)
aw.fly_to([car_position[0], car_position[1] + 20, car_position[2]])
time.sleep(3)  # Wait for 3 seconds

# Set yaw to zero
aw.set_yaw(0)
```

This code performs the following tasks:

1. **Get the car's position**: The position of the car is retrieved using `aw.get_position("car")`, which provides the current X, Y, and Z coordinates of the car.
2. **Inspect from the front**: The drone flies to a point 20 meters in the positive X direction from the car's position using `fly_to()`. After reaching this point, the code waits for 3 seconds using `time.sleep(3)`.
3. **Inspect from the back**: The drone then flies to a point 20 meters in the negative X direction from the car's position and waits for another 3 seconds.
4. **Inspect from the right side**: The drone moves to a point 20 meters in the positive Y direction from the car's position and waits for 3 seconds.
5. **Set yaw to zero**: Finally, the drone's yaw is set to zero using `aw.set_yaw(0)`, orienting the drone to face forward along the X-axis.

This sequence allows for a thorough inspection of the car from the specified points.

user: 
Great! I want you to fly to the turbine 1 until 15m distance on the X axis in the negative direction, and reach an altitude of 50 meters. Remember that you are on the front side of the turbine right now. Right after that, lower your altitude to 30 meters and fly to the next turbine until 15-meter distance in the negative direction, and reach an altitude of 50 meters again.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
# Get the position of turbine1
turbine1_position = aw.get_position("turbine1")

# Fly to turbine1 until 15m distance on the X axis in the negative direction and reach an altitude of 50 meters
aw.fly_to([turbine1_position[0] - 15, turbine1_position[1], 50])

# Lower altitude to 30 meters
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], 30])

# Get the position of turbine2
turbine2_position = aw.get_position("turbine2")

# Fly to turbine2 until 15m distance on the X axis in the negative direction and reach an altitude of 50 meters
aw.fly_to([turbine2_position[0] - 15, turbine2_position[1], 50])
```

This code performs the following tasks:

1. **Get the position of turbine1**: The position of turbine1 is retrieved using `aw.get_position("turbine1")`, which provides the current X, Y, and Z coordinates of turbine1.
2. **Fly to turbine1**: The drone flies to a point that is 15 meters in the negative X direction from turbine1's position while reaching an altitude of 50 meters using `fly_to()`.
3. **Lower altitude to 30 meters**: The drone's altitude is then lowered to 30 meters by flying to the current X and Y coordinates while setting the Z coordinate to 30.
4. **Get the position of turbine2**: The position of turbine2 is retrieved using `aw.get_position("turbine2")`.
5. **Fly to turbine2**: Finally, the drone flies to a point that is 15 meters in the negative X direction from turbine2's position while reaching an altitude of 50 meters.

This sequence allows the drone to navigate between the two turbines while adjusting its altitude as specified.

user: 
Let's inspect this turbine, perform the following tasks in an order, one by one. I want you to move backwards 15 meters on the X axis, wait for 3 seconds and fly back to your first position. After that you'll repeat the process for the backside of the turbine in the following instructions. You should fly 10 meters rightwards, 30 meters forward, 10 meters leftwards and then set yaw to zero to inspect the turbine from the backside. Finally move 10 meters forward, and wait for 3 seconds.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import time

# Get the current position of the drone
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()

# Move backwards 15 meters on the X axis
aw.fly_to([current_position[0] - 15, current_position[1], current_position[2]])
time.sleep(3)  # Wait for 3 seconds

# Fly back to the original position
aw.fly_to([current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2]])

# Move to the backside of the turbine
# Fly 10 meters rightwards (positive Y direction)
aw.fly_to([current_position[0], current_position[1] + 10, current_position[2]])

# Fly 30 meters forward (positive X direction)
aw.fly_to([current_position[0] + 30, current_position[1] + 10, current_position[2]])

# Fly 10 meters leftwards (negative Y direction)
aw.fly_to([current_position[0] + 30, current_position[1], current_position[2]])

# Set yaw to zero
aw.set_yaw(0)

# Move 10 meters forward (positive X direction)
aw.fly_to([current_position[0] + 40, current_position[1], current_position[2]])

# Wait for 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)
```

This code performs the following tasks in order:

1. **Get the current position of the drone**: The current position is retrieved using `aw.get_drone_position()`.
2. **Move backwards 15 meters on the X axis**: The drone flies to a point that is 15 meters in the negative X direction from its current position and waits for 3 seconds.
3. **Fly back to the original position**: The drone returns to its original position using `fly_to()`.
4. **Move to the backside of the turbine**:
   - **Fly 10 meters rightwards**: The drone moves 10 meters in the positive Y direction.
   - **Fly 30 meters forward**: The drone then moves 30 meters in the positive X direction.
   - **Fly 10 meters leftwards**: The drone moves 10 meters in the negative Y direction.
5. **Set yaw to zero**: The drone's yaw is set to zero using `aw.set_yaw(0)`, orienting it to face forward along the X-axis.
6. **Move 10 meters forward**: The drone moves 10 meters in the positive X direction.
7. **Wait for 3 seconds**: Finally, the code waits for 3 seconds to allow for inspection.

This sequence allows for a thorough inspection of the turbine from both the front and the backside.

user: 
Amazing! As a final task, lower your altitude to 25 meters to not to hit the wheel of the turbine and then land the drone 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
# Lower altitude to 25 meters
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], 25])

# Get the position of the car
car_position = aw.get_position("car")

# Land the drone 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis (negative direction)
aw.fly_to([car_position[0] - 10, car_position[1], 25])

# Land the drone
aw.land()
```

This code performs the following tasks:

1. **Lower altitude to 25 meters**: The drone's altitude is lowered to 25 meters by flying to the current X and Y coordinates while setting the Z coordinate to 25.
2. **Get the position of the car**: The position of the car is retrieved using `aw.get_position("car")`, which provides the current X, Y, and Z coordinates of the car.
3. **Land the drone 10 meters away from the car**: The drone flies to a point that is 10 meters in the negative X direction from the car's position while maintaining the altitude of 25 meters.
4. **Land the drone**: Finally, the drone is commanded to land using `aw.land()`.

This sequence ensures that the drone safely lowers its altitude and lands at the specified distance from the car.
