move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
    aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
    ```

    This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

assistant: 
Understood. I will use the functions you provided to command the drone and ask clarifying questions if there are multiple objects of the same type without a specific name provided. I will refer to the objects in the scene using the exact names given, and follow the axis conventions where forward is positive X, right is positive Y, and up is positive Z. Please provide the task you need me to perform with the drone.

user: 
Take off please.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
aw.takeoff()
```

This code uses the `takeoff()` function to command the drone to take off from its current position on the ground.

user: 
Fly 30 meters up.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
current_position = aw.get_drone_position()
new_position = [current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2] + 30]
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

Explanation:
1. `current_position = aw.get_drone_position()` gets the current position of the drone as a list of three floats [x, y, z].
2. `new_position = [current_position[0], current_position[1], current_position[2] + 30]` creates a new list with the same x and y coordinates as the current position, but with the z coordinate increased by 30 meters.
3. `aw.fly_to(new_position)` commands the drone to fly to the new position, which is 30 meters above the current position.

user: 
Now I want you to draw a circle with 45 meters radius, you can use the math.cos() and math.sin() functions to calculate the points of the circle. Remember that the drone has a width of 2 meters.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import math

radius = 45
num_points = 36  # Number of points to approximate the circle
angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_points  # Angle between each point

# Start at the current drone position
start_pos = aw.get_drone_position()

path = [start_pos]
for i in range(num_points):
    angle = i * angle_step
    x = start_pos[0] + (radius + 1) * math.cos(angle)  # Add 1 meter to account for drone width
    y = start_pos[1] + (radius + 1) * math.sin(angle)
    z = start_pos[2]
    path.append([x, y, z])

aw.fly_path(path)
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `math` module to use the `cos` and `sin` functions.
2. Set the radius of the circle to 45 meters.
3. Set the number of points to approximate the circle (`num_points`). Higher values will result in a smoother circle.
4. Calculate the angle step between each point using `angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_points`.
5. Get the starting position of the drone using `start_pos = aw.get_drone_position()`.
6. Create an empty list `path` to store the points of the circle, and add the starting position as the first point.
7. Loop through `num_points` iterations, and in each iteration:
    - Calculate the current angle using `angle = i * angle_step`.
    - Calculate the x and y coordinates of the current point using the circle equation with `radius + 1` to account for the drone's width of 2 meters.
    - Set the z coordinate to the current altitude (`start_pos[2]`).
    - Append the current point `[x, y, z]` to the `path` list.
8. After the loop, call `aw.fly_path(path)` to command the drone to follow the circular path.

This code will make the drone fly in a circular path with a radius of 45 meters, starting from its current position, while accounting for its width of 2 meters.
