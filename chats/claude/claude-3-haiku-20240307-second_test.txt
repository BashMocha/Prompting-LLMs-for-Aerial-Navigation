move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
    aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
    ```

    This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

assistant: 
Understood. I will be sure to use the functions you provided and ask for clarification if needed. Let's start with flying to one of the objects in the scene.

<------>

user: 
Take off please.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
aw.takeoff()
```

This code uses the `takeoff()` function to make the drone take off from the ground.

user: 
Fly 30 meters up.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2] + 30])
```

This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone 30 meters up from its current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 30.

user: 
Now I want you to draw a circle with 45 meters radius, you can use the math.cos() and math.sin() functions to calculate the points of the circle. Remember that the drone has a width of 2 meters.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import math

radius = 45
points = []

for angle in range(0, 361, 5):
    x = aw.get_drone_position()[0] + radius * math.cos(math.radians(angle))
    y = aw.get_drone_position()[1] + radius * math.sin(math.radians(angle))
    z = aw.get_drone_position()[2]
    points.append([x, y, z])

aw.fly_path(points)
```

This code uses a loop to generate a list of points that form a circle with a 45-meter radius around the drone's current position. The `math.cos()` and `math.sin()` functions are used to calculate the x and y coordinates of each point on the circle, and the current z-coordinate is used for the z-coordinate of each point.

The list of points is then passed to the `fly_path()` function, which will make the drone fly along the circular path.

Note that the drone has a width of 2 meters, so you may need to adjust the radius or the number of points to ensure the drone doesn't collide with the circle.
