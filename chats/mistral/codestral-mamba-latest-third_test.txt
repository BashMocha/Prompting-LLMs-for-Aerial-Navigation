system: 
You are an assistant helping me with the AirSim simulator for drones.
When I ask you to do something, you are supposed to give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task using AirSim and then an explanation of what that code does.
You are only allowed to use the functions I have defined for you.
You are not to use any other hypothetical functions that you think might exist.
You can use simple Python functions from libraries such as math and numpy.
You are supposed to output the code in a single block and double-check that the output does not contain syntax errors to avoid outputting erroneous code.

user: 
move 10 units up

<------>

assistant: 
```python
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]+10])
```

This code uses the `fly_to()` function to move the drone to a new position that is 10 units up from the current position. It does this by getting the current position of the drone using `get_drone_position()` and then creating a new list with the same X and Y coordinates, but with the Z coordinate increased by 10. The drone will then fly to this new position using `fly_to()`.

<------>

user: 
Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns the current position of the drone as a list of 3 floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position specified as a list of three arguments corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path specified by the list of points. Each point is again a list of 3 floats corresponding to X, Y, Z coordinates.
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets the yaw of the drone to the specified value in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns the current yaw of the drone in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 3 floats indicating its X,Y,Z coordinates.

A few useful things: 
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains two spheres.

Me: Fly to the sphere.
You: Question - there are two spheres. Which one do you want me to fly to?
Me: Sphere 1, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are two turbines, and three towers. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

In terms of axis conventions, forward means positive X axis. Right means positive Y axis. Up means positive Z axis.

assistant: 
Sure, here is the code that you asked for:

```python
import math

# Take off the drone
aw.takeoff()

# Get the current position of the drone
drone_position = aw.get_drone_position()

# Calculate the new position for the drone to fly to
new_position = [drone_position[0], drone_position[1], drone_position[2] + 10]

# Fly the drone to the new position
aw.fly_to(new_position)

# Set the yaw of the drone to 45 degrees
aw.set_yaw(45)

# Get the current yaw of the drone
current_yaw = aw.get_yaw()

# Print the current yaw of the drone
print("Current yaw of the drone:", current_yaw)
```

Explanation:

1. The `aw.takeoff()` function is used to take off the drone.
2. The `aw.get_drone_position()` function is used to get the current position of the drone as a list of three floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
3. A new position for the drone to fly to is calculated by adding 10 to the current Z coordinate of the drone's position.
4. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used to fly the drone to the new position.
5. The `aw.set_yaw()` function is used to set the yaw of the drone to 45 degrees.
6. The `aw.get_yaw()` function is used to get the current yaw of the drone.
7. The current yaw of the drone is printed using the `print()` function.

user: 
I want you to perform multiple tasks in an order, one by one. Take off, fly up 30 meters, and fly 20 meters forward. Rotate the drone 180 degrees and then, fly 20 meters forward to return your original position.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import math

# Take off the drone
aw.takeoff()

# Fly up 30 meters
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2] + 30])

# Fly 20 meters forward
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] + 20, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])

# Rotate the drone 180 degrees
aw.set_yaw(aw.get_yaw() + 180)

# Fly 20 meters forward to return to original position
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] + 20, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])
```

Explanation:

1. The `aw.takeoff()` function is used to take off the drone.
2. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used to fly the drone up 30 meters by setting the Z coordinate to the current Z coordinate plus 30.
3. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used again to fly the drone 20 meters forward by setting the X coordinate to the current X coordinate plus 20.
4. The `aw.set_yaw()` function is used to rotate the drone 180 degrees by setting the yaw to the current yaw plus 180.
5. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used again to fly the drone 20 meters forward to return to the original position by setting the X coordinate to the current X coordinate plus 20.

user: 
Excellent, I want to inspect the car from three different points on the X axis. You can inspect the car from the front, back, and right side from 20 meters away on the X-axis. After examining the car from a point, wait three seconds and move to the next point. Finally set yaw to zero.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import math
import time

# Inspect car from front
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] + 20, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])
time.sleep(3)

# Inspect car from back
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] - 20, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])
time.sleep(3)

# Inspect car from right
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1] + 20, aw.get_drone_position()[2]])
time.sleep(3)

# Set yaw to zero
aw.set_yaw(0)
```

Explanation:

1. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used to fly the drone to a new position 20 meters away from the current position on the X-axis, inspecting the car from the front.
2. The `time.sleep()` function is used to wait for 3 seconds before moving to the next point.
3. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used again to fly the drone to a new position 20 meters away from the current position on the X-axis in the opposite direction, inspecting the car from the back.
4. The `time.sleep()` function is used to wait for 3 seconds before moving to the next point.
5. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used again to fly the drone to a new position 20 meters away from the current position on the Y-axis, inspecting the car from the right.
6. The `time.sleep()` function is used to wait for 3 seconds before moving to the next point.
7. The `aw.set_yaw()` function is used to set the yaw of the drone to zero.

user: 
Great! I want you to fly to the turbine 1 until 15m distance on the X axis in the negative direction, and reach an altitude of 50 meters. Remember that you are on the front side of the turbine right now. Right after that, lower your altitude to 30 meters and fly to the next turbine until 15-meter distance in the negative direction, and reach an altitude of 50 meters again.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import math

# Fly to turbine 1 at 15 meters distance on the X axis
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] - 15, aw.get_drone_position()[1], 50])

# Lower the altitude to 30 meters
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], 30])

# Fly to turbine 2 at 15 meters distance on the X axis
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] - 15, aw.get_drone_position()[1], 50])
```

Explanation:

1. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used to fly the drone to a new position 15 meters away from the current position on the X-axis and 50 meters above the ground in the negative direction, which is the front side of turbine 1.
2. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used again to lower the altitude of the drone to 30 meters.
3. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used again to fly the drone to a new position 15 meters away from the current position on the X-axis and 50 meters above the ground in the negative direction, which is the front side of turbine 2.

user: 
Let's inspect this turbine, perform the following tasks in an order, one by one. I want you to move backwards 15 meters on the X axis, wait for 3 seconds and fly back to your first position. After that you'll repeat the process for the backside of the turbine in the following instructions. You should fly 10 meters rightwards, 30 meters forward, 10 meters leftwards and then set yaw to zero to inspect the turbine from the backside. Finally move 10 meters forward, and wait for 3 seconds.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import time

# Move backwards 15 meters on the X axis
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] - 15, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])

# Wait for 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)

# Fly back to the original position
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] + 15, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])

# Move 10 meters rightwards
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1] + 10, aw.get_drone_position()[2]])

# Move 30 meters forward
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2] + 30])

# Move 10 meters leftwards
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1] - 10, aw.get_drone_position()[2]])

# Set yaw to zero
aw.set_yaw(0)

# Move 10 meters forward
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0] + 10, aw.get_drone_position()[1], aw.get_drone_position()[2]])

# Wait for 3 seconds
time.sleep(3)
```

Explanation:

1. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used to move the drone 15 meters backwards on the X axis.
2. The `time.sleep()` function is used to wait for 3 seconds.
3. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used to fly back to the original position.
4. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used again to move the drone 10 meters rightwards.
5. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used to move the drone 30 meters forward.

user: 
Amazing! As a final task, lower your altitude to 25 meters to not to hit the wheel of the turbine and then land the drone 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis.

<------>

assistant: 
```python
import math

# Lower the altitude to 25 meters
aw.fly_to([aw.get_drone_position()[0], aw.get_drone_position()[1], 25])

# Calculate the new position for the drone to land 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis
new_position = [aw.get_drone_position()[0] + 10, aw.get_drone_position()[1], 0]

# Land the drone 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis
aw.fly_to(new_position)
```

Explanation:

1. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used to lower the altitude of the drone to 25 meters by setting the Z coordinate to 25.
2. The `aw.get_drone_position()` function is used to get the current position of the drone as a list of three floats corresponding to XYZ coordinates.
3. A new position for the drone to land 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis is calculated by adding 10 to the current X-coordinate of the drone's position and setting the Y-coordinate to zero.
4. The `aw.fly_to()` function is used again to land the drone 10 meters away from the car on the X-axis by setting the X-coordinate to the new X-coordinate calculated in step 3.
