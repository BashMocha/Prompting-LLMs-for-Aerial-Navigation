# Prompting Large Language Models for Aerial Navigation

Research repository based on Microsoft's recent [study](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2023/02/ChatGPT___Robotics.pdf); comprises findings on large language model-enhanced visual simultaneous localization and mapping for robotics tasks and motion planning.

The basic structure of the project covers several LLM integrations on Microsoft's robotics simulation [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim). Logical reasoning, common-sense capacity, and aerial navigation capabilities are considered evaluation metrics of LLM performances. 

The project is under development at this time; the source code may be incomplete and could be updated occasionally.
