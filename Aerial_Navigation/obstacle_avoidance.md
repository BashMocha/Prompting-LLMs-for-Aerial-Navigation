<b>
Assume you are helping me interact with the AirSim simulator for drones. At any given point in time, you have the following abilities. You are also required to output code for some of the requests.

Question - Ask me a clarification question. Reason - Explain why you did something the way you did it. Code - Output a code command that achieves the desired goal.

The simulator contains a drone, along with several objects. Apart from the drone, none of the objects are movable. Within the code, we have the following commands available to us. You are not to use any other hypothetical functions.

get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a vector of 3 floats indicating its X, Y, and Z coordinates.

fly_to(position): Takes a vector of 3 floats as input indicating X, Y, and Z coordinates and commands the drone to fly there.

fly_path(positions): Takes a list of X, Y, and Z positions indicating waypoints along a path and flies the drone along that path.

set_yaw(angle): Set the yaw angle for the drone (in degrees).

Are you ready?

Question: Do you have any specific goals or tasks you'd like to accomplish with the drone in the simulator?

Consider I give you some X, Y, and Z coordinates as a target position and want you to control the drone such that it moves towards the goal while avoiding obstacles in front of it. The drone should take small steps while reassessing the obstacle situation at every step and shouldn't fly directly to the target position.

The drone is equipped with a distance sensor that returns the distance to the closest obstacle directly in front of the drone. You can access it by calling get_distance() function.

I want you to make sure to fly only if there is at least 10 meters of distance in front of the drone. If not, you should rotate the drone until there is at least 10 meters of clearance in the front and then take a step in the direction that the drone is currently facing. Don't forget to face the goal again after taking a step. 

Are you ready?

Code: Sure, here's how we can implement the behavior you described:

```python
def move_towards_goal(target_position):
    # Define a function to rotate the drone until there is at least 10 meters of clearance in front
    def rotate_until_clearance():
        while get_distance() < 10:
            set_yaw(45)  # Rotate the drone by 45 degrees (you can adjust the angle)
    
    # Define a function to face the goal position
    def face_goal():
        current_position = get_position("drone")
        dx = target_position[0] - current_position[0]
        dy = target_position[1] - current_position[1]
        target_yaw = math.atan2(dy, dx) * 180 / math.pi
        set_yaw(target_yaw)
    
    # Fly towards the target position while avoiding obstacles
    while True:
        clearance = get_distance()
        if clearance >= 10:
            fly_to(target_position)
            break
        else:
            rotate_until_clearance()
            face_goal()  # Ensure the drone faces the goal after rotating
            fly_to(get_position("drone"))  # Take a small step in the current direction

# Example usage:
target_position = [100, 50, 20]  # Example target position
move_towards_goal(target_position)
```

This code continuously checks the distance to the closest obstacle in front of the drone. If the distance is less than 10 meters, it rotates the drone until there is sufficient clearance. Then, it takes a small step towards the goal while constantly reassessing the obstacle situation and adjusting the drone's orientation. Once there is enough clearance, it flies directly towards the target position.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<b>
You need to define a step number and a step size to move. Don't just fly to the target. Take a step each time and and check after each step that if there isn't any obstacles in the direction. If there is, rotate the drone, take a step, and rotate the drone to the target again. 
<b/>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code: Got it, let's update the code to take small steps towards the target position while continuously checking for obstacles:

```python
import math

def move_towards_goal(target_position, step_size=5):
    # Define a function to rotate the drone until there is at least 10 meters of clearance in front
    def rotate_until_clearance():
        while get_distance() < 10:
            set_yaw(45)  # Rotate the drone by 45 degrees (you can adjust the angle)
    
    # Define a function to face the goal position
    def face_goal():
        current_position = get_position("drone")
        dx = target_position[0] - current_position[0]
        dy = target_position[1] - current_position[1]
        target_yaw = math.atan2(dy, dx) * 180 / math.pi
        set_yaw(target_yaw)
    
    # Fly towards the target position while avoiding obstacles
    current_position = get_position("drone")
    dx = target_position[0] - current_position[0]
    dy = target_position[1] - current_position[1]
    distance_to_target = math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)
    steps = int(distance_to_target / step_size)
    for _ in range(steps):
        clearance = get_distance()
        if clearance < 10:
            rotate_until_clearance()
        else:
            fly_to([current_position[0] + dx / steps, current_position[1] + dy / steps, target_position[2]])
            face_goal()  # Ensure the drone faces the goal after taking a step
            current_position = get_position("drone")

# Example usage:
target_position = [100, 50, 20]  # Example target position
move_towards_goal(target_position)
```

This code breaks down the distance to the target position into smaller steps based on the specified step size. After each step, it checks for obstacles in front of the drone. If an obstacle is detected, it rotates the drone until there is sufficient clearance, then takes another step. It repeats this process until the drone reaches the target position.
