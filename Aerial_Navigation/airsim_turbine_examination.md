Assume you are helping me interact with the AirSim simulator for drones. At any given point in time, you have the following abilities. You are also required to output code for some of the requests.

- Question - Ask me a clarification question.
- Reason - Explain why you did something the way you did it. 
- Code - Output a code command that achieves the desired goal.

The simulator contains a drone, along with several objects. Apart from the drone, none of the objects are movable. Within the code, we have the following commands available to us. You are not to use any other hypothetical functions.

get_position(object_name): Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a vector of 3 floats indicating its X, Y, and Z coordinates.

fly_to(position): Takes a vector of 3 floats as input indicating X, Y, and Z coordinates and commands the drone to fly there.

fly_path(positions): Takes a list of X, Y, and Z positions indicating waypoints along a path and flies the drone along that path.

Here is a representation of the scene that shows you how to react when we are working with a simulated world that has three bicycles in it.

Me: Fly the drone to the bicycle. 
You: Question - There are three bicycles in the world, which one do you want me to fly the drone to? 
Me: Let's pick the red colored bicycle.

There are two turbines, some solar panels, and an oak tree in the world.

Are you ready?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I am ready.

Please let me know what specific task you would like the drone to perform in the AirSim simulator.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fly to the oak tree.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question - There is one oak tree in the world, correct? If there are multiple, please specify which one you want the drone to fly to.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, correct. There is only one oak tree in the scene.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great, I will command the drone to fly to the oak tree.

```python
# Get the position of the oak tree
oak_tree_position = get_position("oak_tree")

# Fly the drone to the oak tree
fly_to(oak_tree_position)
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great, now fly to the the turbine while keeping 15 meters from the turbine along the X axis, and stay at the altitude of 45 meters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question - There are two turbines in the world. Could you specify which turbine you would like the drone to fly to?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's number the turbines as 'Turbine 1' and 'Turbine 2'. Fly to the 'Turbine 1'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understood. I will fly the drone to 'Turbine 1' while maintaining a distance of 15 meters along the X axis and staying at an altitude of 45 meters.

```python
# Get the position of Turbine 1
turbine1_position = get_position("Turbine 1")

# Calculate the target position with a 15 meter offset along the X axis
target_position = [turbine1_position[0] + 15, turbine1_position[1], 45]

# Fly the drone to the calculated target position
fly_to(target_position)
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent. Now fly to the behind the turbine by moving up, forward, down and rotation respectiveley. First fly 20 meters on the Y axis to get a higher point to avoid collision with the turbine. Next move 20 meters forward to pass the turbine and lower your altitude by 20 meters back to your origin altitude. Finally, rotate the drone 180 degrees. You can use the set_yaw() function to rotate the drone. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question - Can you confirm if the origin altitude is the altitude at which the drone was flying before it was instructed to fly to the turbine? This would help in calculating the new altitude correctly. Additionally, could you specify the exact current altitude if it's different from the assumed 45 meters?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The origin altitude is the current altitude of the drone where the drone is instructed already for flying to the turbine.

The current altitude is 45 meters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understood. I'll execute the sequence of movements as instructed.

```python
# Fly 20 meters up on the Y axis to get to a higher point
higher_position = [target_position[0], target_position[1] + 20, target_position[2]]
fly_to(higher_position)

# Move 20 meters forward to pass the turbine
forward_position = [higher_position[0] + 20, higher_position[1], higher_position[2]]
fly_to(forward_position)

# Lower the altitude by 20 meters back to the original altitude
lower_position = [forward_position[0], forward_position[1], forward_position[2] - 20]
fly_to(lower_position)

# Rotate the drone 180 degrees
set_yaw(180)
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wonderful. Can you return to your previous position before being instructed to go behind the turbine?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly, I'll navigate the drone back to its previous position before going behind the turbine.

```python
# Fly back to the position before moving behind the turbine
fly_to(forward_position)  # Move back to the position after passing the turbine
fly_to(higher_position)   # Move back to the higher position
fly_to(target_position)   # Move back to the position behind the turbine
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to higher your altitude by 20 meters first, move forward by 20 meters, lower your altitude by 20 meters, and then rotate the drone 180 degrees again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it, I'll adjust the sequence accordingly.

```python
# Fly 20 meters up to increase altitude
higher_altitude_position = [target_position[0], target_position[1], target_position[2] + 20]
fly_to(higher_altitude_position)

# Move 20 meters forward
forward_position = [higher_altitude_position[0] + 20, higher_altitude_position[1], higher_altitude_position[2]]
fly_to(forward_position)

# Lower the altitude by 20 meters
lower_altitude_position = [forward_position[0], forward_position[1], forward_position[2] - 20]
fly_to(lower_altitude_position)

# Rotate the drone 180 degrees again
set_yaw(180)
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awesome. Now, fly to the second turbine while keeping 15 meters from the turbine along the X-axis. We need to examine the blades of the turbine. The first blade is oriented horizontally rightwards. Fly 30 meters right from your current position and get back to your position.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, I'll fly the drone to the second turbine while maintaining a 15-meter distance along the X-axis. Then, I'll navigate the drone to examine the blades of the turbine.

```python
# Get the position of the second turbine
turbine2_position = get_position("Turbine 2")

# Calculate the target position with a 15 meter offset along the X axis
target_position = [turbine2_position[0] - 15, turbine2_position[1], turbine2_position[2]]

# Fly the drone to the second turbine while maintaining the distance along the X-axis
fly_to(target_position)

# Fly 30 meters right from the current position
right_position = [target_position[0] + 30, target_position[1], target_position[2]]
fly_to(right_position)

# Get back to the original position
fly_to(target_position)
```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To inspect the second blade, I need you to fly in the top-left direction at an angle of 30 degrees from the horizontal axis. 

You should fly in the YZ plane for a distance of 30 meters, and then back to the current position.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it, I'll fly the drone to inspect the second blade by moving in the top-left direction at a 30-degree angle from the horizontal axis.

```python
import math

# Calculate the coordinates for the top-left direction at a 30-degree angle
angle_degrees = 30
angle_radians = math.radians(angle_degrees)
delta_y = 30 * math.sin(angle_radians)
delta_z = 30 * math.cos(angle_radians)
top_left_position = [right_position[0], right_position[1] + delta_y, right_position[2] + delta_z]

# Fly to the top-left direction
fly_to(top_left_position)

# Fly back to the current position
fly_to(right_position)
```
